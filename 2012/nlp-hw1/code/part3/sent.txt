At McDonalds, we knwo that nothing complements a hamburger like tasty hot french fries.

Regarding french fries, we feel that fresh is the best way.

A french fry is only as good as the potato it comes from.

So we use fresh large potatoes.

And we deliver them fresh to our stores.

Every day, we take whole new potatoes.

We prepare the potatoes individually.

Then we cook them in trans-fat-free vegetable oil.

We do not use a freezer.
